	a <- 5 == 3
  // a = false
  // Reason: we are comparing the number 5 with the number 3 which results as false
	b <- 4 <> 3
  // a = true
  // Reason: We are comparing if the 4 and 3 are different which results in true
	c <- 7 > 7
  // c = false
  // Reason: We are comparing if the number 7 is greater than the number 7 which results in false
	d <- 4 < 4
  // d = false
  // Reason: We are comparing if the number 4 is less than the number 4 which results in false
	e <- 100 <= 90
  // e = false
  // Reason: We are comparing if the number 100 is less than the number 90 which results in false
	f <- 40 >= 40
  // f = True
  // Reason: We are comparing if the number 7 is greater or equal than the number 7 which results in true
