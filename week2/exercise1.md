#Logic Problem

The answer on this is thhat Bob is the only student who studied.

Basing my analisis on Alice's response, since we see that she lies saying that Nobodystudied, which leaves room for us to think that at least, one person studied and checking on the other premises we can come up to the conclusion that Bob studied.
