#Exercise about the Treasures:

Find the treasure. Link to statement: https://github.com/corecodeio/devguide-fundamentals-2022-04/tree/main/src/technologies/2022/week01/challenges/e06/desc

My answer on this is: A and C

1. This because one of the instructions given is that all messages are lies, therefore, all of the messages were contradicting each other. since the first chest said: The middle chest has a treasure which was telling us that there was nothing in the second chest the second chest said that all chests had a treasure which was another lie and the third one said that just one chest had treasures, then, that reaffirmed my hyphotesis of the chest a and c being the ones with treasures
