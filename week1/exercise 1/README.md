How to convert Celsius degrees to Fahreinheit - Algorithm

1. Get the value in Celsius degrees and assign it to the variable T.
2. Multiply the variable T by the constant S1 which has the value of 1.8
3. Assign the result to the value Result.
4. Sum the Result with the constant S2 which has a value of 32 and assign it again to Result.
5. Print the Result variable

===================================================================

Calculate the volume of a piramid

1. Request the value of the base of the Pyramid and assign it to the variable B
2. Request the value of the height of the Pyramid and assign it to the variable h
3. Multiply the variable B by the variable h and by the constant S1 which has the value of 1/3
4. Assign that value to the variable result.
5. Print the variable result.


============================================================================

Calculate the volume of a cube - Algorithm

1. Request the value of any edge and assign it to the variable S
2. Power the variable S by 3 and assign its value to the variable result.
3. Print the Variable Result
